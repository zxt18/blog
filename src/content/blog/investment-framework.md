While the notion of an "Ultimate Systematic Investing Machine" capable of predicting market movements and generating extraordinary gains seems like something market strategists should strive for, the reality is that such a constantly self-adjusting system is virtually impossible. This impossibility arises from the multidimensional factors that drive the markets, whether they are macroeconomic, geopolitical, or psychological in nature. Successful systematic strategies tend to focus on specific, well-defined inefficiencies within their scope rather than trying to capture full market complexity. The need for overly complex mathematical models that are often fed noisy, unnormalized, or garbage data, to have forecasting value, is often a bullshit sales tactic to attract prospective investors, defying Occam's razor principle of favoring simplicity.

For retail investors seeking a replicable framework that could lead to outsized gains, the name of the game lies in a few fundamental principles:

1. The Key to Outsize Returns
2. Less Is More
3. It all matters : Diversification, Position Sizing, and Leverage
4. Be an Investor, Not a Gambler
5. Investment Screening Framework

I will explore each of these elements in detail to develop a time-tested, retail-replicable investing framework.

### The Key to Outsize Returns
Just like how the house in a casino has an edge over you, the retail investor actually has an edge over instutional investors when it comes to the stock market, if you compete in a **longer time frame**. A powerful and often overlooked edge in investing comes in the simple concept of **time arbitrage**. The edge simply comes from institutional investors ("smart money") consistently having short-term performance pressures, forcing these institutions to hop around ideas every 6-18 months. These fund managers have to benchmark their performance on an annually (somtimes quarterly) basis to attract investment inflows, so they can't be holding shares of companies that are still in the midst of finding their footing to grow revenues. 

Besides that, majority of instutional funds also tend to shy away from stocks that are severely impaired in its stock price, even when some of these drawdowns present compelling turnaround opportunities. The majority tend to go for companies that have seemingly forecastable financials, meaning stocks that have shown consistent growth in the top and bottom line. This risk-averse behavior of smart money is driven partly by mandate restrictions and mostly career risk concerns. Putting yourself in their shoes for a minute, imagine going on Bloomberg pitching an idea against the consensus and being wrong for more than 6 months - not many have the courage to do so hence why they go for companies.

So if you're an investor who has none of these restrictions, and can overtime build a position in investment ideas that are at peak pessimism but would eventually revitalize and show growth in 6-18 months from now, and hold them from peak pessimism throughout optimism to euphoria, you will undoubtedly make outsize returns.

### Less Is More 
A counter-intuitive notion when it comes to investing is that **less is often more**. Inaction is often the best action when it comes to investing. The instincts that make one a successful entrepreneur can make them a poor investor -- there's no reward for constant action (buys and sells) when markets tend to act randomly in the short-term as you accumulate trading costs.

As Warren Buffett famously said, "Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ." It's not just intellect but also a emotional discipline and restraint that makes you a successful investor. **The intellectual work necessary to search for an investment opportunity and the exit price, happens before the allocation**. Beyond that, the remaining work is having the temperament to stick with your game plan. I'll talk more about the stock picking later.


### It all matters : Diversification, Sizing and Leverage
The only time-tested way to provide downside protection to your portfolio is not anticipating the next black-swan event ("financial argmageddon"), but through **true diversification**, achieved not merely by the number of investments but by the uncorrelated nature of those investments. For instance, a portfolio consisting of 100 altcoins would not be considered diversified, nor would a portfolio of 50 biotech companies racing to develop a cancer cure, or betting on 5 different New Electric Vehicle companies. In such cases, the thesis of your investment is driven by a single underlying factor, for altcoins, it would be lack of government trust | speculative cryptocurrency trends; for biotech companies, it would be the success or failure of a specific drug trial; and for EV companies, it would be new energy vehicle policies.  The key is to always diversify across industries/countries if possible. **You however can't diversify away systematic risks that drive the overall market** , such as interest rates (cost of borrowing), overall consumer confidence, economic growth etc. Your portfolio would still be subjected to these broader market risks, but as I would later discuss in 3. and 4, these risks will often be compensated.

Sizing is important. Always size your positions correctly, by the risk-profile and implied move of a stock. If a stock has equal chance of doubling or folding in half, you probably would want to keep the allocation low in case of when it folds in half, as it takes a 100% gain to recover from a 50% loss. Where as for established companies with great economic moats like Coca-Cola, it could possibly be a 25% allocation without incurring huge unwarranted volatility to your portfolio, that the greater market would not experience.

Finally, as Munger famously said, there are three things that could ruin a person: "Liquor, Ladies, and Leverage." And hopefully, readers of this blog have the discipline to manager the firs two vices as I would only elaborate on the third. You really should never take on leverage as you want to maximize resilience and time in the market. Leverage is a double-edged sword and would increase the chances of you getting wiped out. This applies even to those who do not invest on margin or partake in leveraged option strategies. If you have upcoming financial commitments and you're using that money to invest, you are effectively employing leverage. This pressure often shifts your mindset from being an investor, to a degenerate gambler.

### Differences between a Gambler and an Investor
The true distinction between a gambler and an investor lies in two fundamental aspects. . The first part of which I have addressed is having a poor risk-management strategy, one-way-ticket to financial oblivion by risking it all on the roulette table, instead of sizing it into 50 bets. The second part is **playing games with no edge**, meaning your odds of winning are nothing better than coin-flip. The reason why the house always wins as they've calibrated their games to have a slight edge over you, and they have sufficient cash to ruin you before you ever come close to ruining them. That's why casino regulars are called gamblers and never investors, and a successful gambler (in a casino) really just means they haven't gambled enough. 

From a risk-reward perspective, it's these two factors that separate the serious investors and entrepreneurs from the gamblers -– not whether they are regulars at Hippodrome Casino down by Leicester Square. I say this because you could easily turn the stock market investments or your business ventures into a casino like gamble e.g. Purchasing stocks with asymmetric downside risk or operating a business in fiercely competitive markets with little chance of gaining a foothold.

However, unlike the casino where generating a sustainable edge is virtually impossible (unless you're a legend like Phil Ivey), the beauty of the markets lies in their non-zero-sum nature. Your winnings don't necessarily translate into someone else's losses. Everyone can win together. Furthermore, there exist multiple time-tested principles and traits that possess strong predictive power, tilting the odds in your favor – traits I'll delve into in points 3 and 4. 

### Top Down Bottom Up Approach 
The stock price of any stock can be mainly decomposed into two factors. The macro factor and the idiosyncratic factor. The greatest macro variable that would alter the course of the economy is interest rates (Fed Funds Rate) which is ultimately set by the Federal Reserve. Their ultimate decision is then dependent on multiple economic variables of the US. (think CPI, PCE, PPI, GDP, Payrolls, PMI). And the case i'm making for the second half of 2024 is that rates will be cut. The dual-mandate of the FED is this : 
1) Keep prices stable at 2% inflation within the US (The Fed's favorite gauge for inflation is Core-PCE)
2) Achieve maximum employment

January inflation numbers have temporarily inflected, mostly because companies tend to raise prices in January anyway. But if you zoom out, this is the trend : 
The matter of the fact is, the FED's immediate hike in FED Funds Rate have a lagged-effect in the market, meaning only when companies and indivduals have to refinance their debt obligations would they feel the pain that the base rate is now 5.25% not 0.25%. And the longer the FED holds rates steady, the higher the chances of them bringing the economy to a hold, potentially entering treacherous waters of deflation. When that happens, even multiple immediate cuts wouldn't save the economy. Interest Rates are 3% too restrictive relative to the inflation number, and Jereme Powell understands this. Here's my base case of what I think would play out. J.Pow continues the hawk talk in every FOMC meeting to keep market expectations in check, but once he has the data that the lagged effect of increased borrowing costs is again kicking in, reversing the narrative that inflation will inflect,  he would immediately cut rates in the nearest FOMC meeting,  **without any notice**. That could happen in April, May, June or even as late as July, but it definitely will happen. And when it happens, he wouldn't send you a notice one month prior.

## Size Matters
As much as you want to here her say size doesn't, it certainly does when it comes to investing. You would want to size your positions in a way that in an event of a situation where the said company is under huge distress and the stock price tanks, you wouldn't be put out on the stretcher. What that means is that stay invested in 8-16 companies at all time. If one company goes to zero, hopefully the remaining others could drive your overall gains up.



The question to prompt the careful-minded investor is this : In the midst of insurmountable hype and momentum around the equities related to **AI** (of which the underlying mechanisms are simply a combination of mathematics and computation), would it be wise to now hop on the hype-train and ride it out to the rumored promise-land ? Or should the diligent-investor look for stocks that have been **impaired in terms of their price**, of which's downturn was further amplified by the Federal Reserve's quickest tightening cycle in decades, but which fundamentals are sound and have a management team that are diligently executing their turnaround plan to get the impaired parts of the business fixed ? 

The point i'm trying to make is that you don't have to take on all battles for the sake of conflating your ego. You don't have to participate or have an opinion in every hot stock. No one really knows what is the Total Addressable Market of GPUs. If anything, you should be worried when sell-side talking heads, with little to no background in technology, are all talking about "AI" while trying to sell you the new AI ETF their firm has just launched. The beauty of investing in equities is that you could hand-pick your battles, and you would want to pick in a such a way that you have greater odds of winning, and in the unfortunate event of losing, you could withstand the damage and fight for another day.

Hence, the ultimate investing framework, that has stood against the test of time, which is also robust to volatility and tail-events, is simply investing with no leveerage, on 8-16 companies that have limited downside and unlimited upside. Whereby the allocations are sized in a way that in an the extremely unlikely event of one or two bankcruptcies, it would not put you out on a stretcher. 


Cautionary Advised : 
The following is opinion and not advice. Your investment objective, risk-tolerance and timeframe might be different from mine so do consult your financial advisor.

Below I would make the case of the likely breakout of the S&P-500 and the likely broadening of the rally to include the other 400 equities that have been left-for-dead. Before I proceed to explain my stance, here's a little primer on U.S Interest Rates (Fed Funds Rate), and how it is an significant determinant of borrowing costs hence economic activit. Whether business owners are in the mode of expansion or consumers are in the mood of financing their next purchase of high-ticket items is strongly determined by it. 

The FEDs dual-mandate is simply keeping nflation at the ballpark of 2% all while maintaining maximum employment for americans. Throughout 2022-2023 the FED took on the most aggresive interest-rate hiking cycle to curb inflation rising from 0.25% to 5.25%. 

I would then make the case that going forward, the FED has all the tools to pilot a soft-landing given the strong workforce and economy, amplified by a significant boost in productivity driven by Gen-AI capabilities and better global collaboration infrastrucutre given the lockdowns of COVID.

Although the S&P-500 are currently at All-Time Highs, history tells us that it is tough to short new-highs, and the US markets have always broke out ATH resistance over a 3 year window. For the doubtful investor who focuses on the fundamentals and not statistics with a small sample-size. I would also list out the state of the US Economy.

## US Economy Outlook

Inflation measures such as the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and the Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) are approaching the FED's target rate.

Credit Card Deliquency Rates of 2023 are nowhere near that of the Great Financial Crisis or Pre-Great Financial Crisis era.

Capital on the sidelines are increasing to all time highs. This hints risk-averse than risk-on. Money market fund assets hit a new record high in February as savers and investors continue to pile in :

My favorite statistic comes from Tom Lee from FundStrat which suggests that in the past 18 elections since 1950 (post WWII), markets tends to perform well in election years, and perform even better there were >10% gains on the indices over the past year.

## It's not the action, but the expectation


## Recession or continued GDP growth ?

Throughout 2022 - 2024, Global CEOs had been **preparing for a recession that never came**. This is evident in the number of Corporate Transcript mentinos of the term "Operational Efficiency". This means companies are now leaner than ever while maintaining the same or even better output capacity.

![Emphasis on Operational Efficiency](../../../public/cost-cutting.png)

[Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) tracks layoffs of tech-companies around the world. Notice the clumping of layoffs in 2022 extending to early 2024. The firing bloodbath did not exclusively happen to tech companies but also to other industries partly due to the higher cost of borrowing and simply the instilled fear from sensational news. What isn't shown in this graph is the hiring surge that

![Tech Layoffs.fyi](../../../public/tech-layoffs.png)

With that said, layoffs only show half of the full picture. New jobs are being created is increasing as well shown by the steady unemployment rate remaining below 4%.

We had a technical recession - two subsequent quarters of negative GDP growth, which blew pass everyone's memory.

Productivity growth - the ability of an entity to produce more with the same capital investment inputs and labor - is the primary driver of GDP growth. The productivity growth enabled by the groundbreaking Gen-AI models (think ChatGPT, Gemini) are akin to the Information Technology revolution we had in the 1990s-2010s. The output we are ought to generate will remain and may even exceed despite the reduction in labor inputs.

New jobs were created

We will hence see margins expanding when the E in P/E (Earnings).
are growing, while their fixed-costs have been shrinking.
CEOs were preparing for a recession that never came, hence we will see margin expansion, when the E (earnings) are growing while their cost-basis has shrunked.

Rather, I would advise investors to conduct due diligence on those equities that have lagged behind beause of the Federal Reserve's most aggressive tightening cycle in modern times. Financial markets, ever oscillating between fear and greed, are prone to overexuberance on the upside and overpessimism on the downside. With the potential for monetary policy to turn accommodative as macroeconomic conditions evolve, the risk-reward ratio argues for some measured risk-taking in anticipation of a more constructive backdrop ahead.

Instead, I'm suggesting investors take a deeper look at the laggards - those the casualties of the Federal Reserve's most aggresive tightening cycle in modern times. The Stock Market, just like a pendulum, is ever oscillating between fear and greed. Asset prices tend to overshoot to the upside in exuberance and will overshoot to the downside in the face of uncertainty and pessimism. The ultimate framework is to focus on those names trading at pronounced discounts that maintain robust fundamentals or multiple catalysts that could unlock substantial value. This is especially prudent for rate-sensitive sectors and emerging markets.

The point I'm trying to make is to look for companies that have overshot to the downside and have plenty of catalysts laid out (or what poker players like to call - "many outs"). This is particularly true for companies that fall under the theme of - "Interest Rate Sensitive" and "Emerging Markets". With interest rates expected to fall in the future, investors may want to take on more risk in anticipation of an improving environment.

## Investing Framework

The framework and strategy deployed is - Top Down Bottom Up.

1. From the macro/general-market point of view, is 2024 the time to put on risk or lighten up and go risk-off ?

2. Drill down to sector to find those that would benefit from the macro tailwinds. It would be much better if the sector was previously unfavored to provide a margin of safety during the purchase.

3. Drill down to each individual company within those sectors that are likely to benefit, and perform the due diligence.


## Interest Rates outlook

## Interest Rate Sensitive US Stocks

## Emerging Markets

Looking back into 2023, peak pessimism happened when market participants were unsure of what the terminal interest rates would have to be, for the Federal Reserve to achieve its dual mandate - low and stable inflation (around 2%), with maximum employment.

The Russell 2000 index crashed between July 2023 and November 2023, but quickly bottomed once the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data turned out cooler-than-expected. A lower-interest rate environment will benefit the interest rate sensitive sectors e.g. Consumer Discretionary, Real-Estate, Dividend Stocks etc.

My philosophy is simple, focus on names with the most outs, while having a margin of safety.



The investment thesis is this : 
1) Buy companies that have been temporarily impaired due to mistakes (mismanagement of inventory, F.U.D news, cyclical downturns) and hence marked down and sold at peak pessimism, that will eventually recover.
