What differentiates an investor and an economist is that one bears real financial consequences while the other may operate with theoretical detachment. Any opinion on markets would only carry weight when the talking head has a sizable stake backing it - when the person has "skin in the game". To uphold this principle, I have setup a separate 20,000 USD portfolio that would provide transparency of the holdings, transparency on the diff between what I pitch and what I do.

Investment mandate of the public portfolio : 
1. Initial portfolio size will be 20,000 USD.
2. Monthly inflows of 4,200 USD from April 2024 - September 2024 as a form of Dollar Cost Averaging. 
3. A detailed portfolio report will be created for each half of the year.
4. Option contracts if purchased will be solely for hedging purposes, not for speculation purposes.
5. Shares will only be sold when companies have realized fair or full value.
6. Diversify across 8-16 holdings at all times.
