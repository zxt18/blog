Any opinion on markets would only carry weight when the talking head has a sizable stake backing it - when the person has "skin in the game". 

To uphold this principle, I have setup a new public portfolio that would provide transparency of the "diff" between what I pitch and what I do.


### The Investment Mandate
Investment mandate of the public portfolio : 

1. Initial portfolio size will be approximately ~21,000 USD.
2. Monthly inflows approximately ~6,300 USD from April 2024 - September 2024 as a form of Dollar Cost Averaging. 
3. A detailed portfolio report will be created for each half of the year.
4. Option contracts if purchased will be solely for hedging purposes, not for speculation purposes.
5. Shares will only be sold when companies have realized fair value.
6. Diversify across 8-16 holdings at all times.
