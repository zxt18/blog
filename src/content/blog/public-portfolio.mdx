Any opinion on markets would only carry weight when the talking head has a sizable stake backing it - when the person has "skin in the game". 

To uphold this principle, I have setup a new public portfolio that would provide transparency of the "diff" between what I pitch and what I do.


### The Investment Mandate
Investment mandate of the public portfolio : 

1. Initial portfolio size will be approximately ~21,000 USD.
2. Monthly inflows approximately ~6,300 USD from April 2024 - September 2024 as a form of Dollar Cost Averaging. 
3. The fund will invest primarily in the equity securities of companies.
4. Option contracts if purchased will be solely for hedging purposes, not for speculation purposes.
5. Shares will only be sold when companies have realized fair value.
6. The fund will have no more than 30% of its total assets invested in any single sector, as defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).
7. Diversify across 8-16 individual equity securities at all times.
